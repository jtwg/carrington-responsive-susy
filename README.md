carrington-responsive-susy
==========================

Based on Crowd Favorite's "Carrington JAM" WordPress theme framework. This adds some basic responsiveness via Susy, so requires Compass to compile the CSS. It also changes some of the Carrington file naming conventions to allow for more flexibility in template file names.
